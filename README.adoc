The website is hosted on Github Pages, with the default `github.io` domain name.
The site sources live in the `site` branch. For a Github Pages website at the
user or organization level, the built website needs to be pushed on the `master`
branch.

The site generator is https://antora.org[Antora]. This website generator can take sources
from multiple git repositories. This allows us to keep the documentation for 
Terraform providers and modules in their respective repositories. On top of that,
Antora supports generating documentation for multiple versions of the providers
and modules.

If you want a good example of what is achievable with this site generator, have a look
at the documentation of https://docs.couchbase.com[Couchbase].
