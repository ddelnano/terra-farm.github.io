# Terra-farm community website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/terra-farm/terra-farm.github.io.svg?branch=site)](https://travis-ci.org/terra-farm/terra-farm.github.io)

The website is hosted on Github Pages, with the default `github.io` domain name.
The site sources live in the `site` branch. For a Github Pages website at the
user or organization level, the built website needs to be pushed on the `master`
branch.
